# Low-Level Game-Making Library (LLGML)

## Description
This project was made as an effort to simplify the complexity of OpenGL's various features and act as a sort of wrapper for them. Many repetitive tasks are wrapped, such as window creation, rendering, etc.

This was made with a single window and GL_Context in mind, so the program has a global window and context which are accessed throughout the project.

### TODO:
* Model View Projection Matrix for 3D
* 2D/3D switching option?
* Basic shape rendering
* STL file rendering

### Notes:
* For simplicity and convenience when working in OpenGL, all coordinates are right-handed, with Y as the up direction.
